Sure, let's go through a dry run and then discuss the solution and 
approach for the "Single-Threaded CPU" problem on LeetCode.

Problem Statement:
You are given n tasks represented by an array tasks, where 
tasks[i] = [enqueueTime_i, processingTime_i] means that the ith task will 
be available to process at time enqueueTime_i and will take processingTime_i 
units of time to process. A single-threaded CPU can only execute one task at a 
time and will execute the task with the smallest processing time first. If two 
tasks have the same processing time, the task with the smaller enqueue time is 
scheduled first. Write a function to return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

Dry Run:
Consider the input tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[3,2],[4,1]].

Initially, the tasks are sorted in reverse order based on enqueue time: 
tasks = [[4,1],[3,2],[2,4],[1,2]].
We maintain a heap to keep track of available tasks at any given time.
Time starts at 0. We look at tasks that are available at or before time 0 
and add them to the heap: [4,1] is added.
The task with the smallest processing time in the heap is selected and processed. 
The result is [4], and time becomes 1.
We repeat this process until all tasks are processed: [4,2,3,1].


import heapq

def getOrder(tasks):
    # Enumerate tasks with their original indices
    tasks = [(enq, proc, i) for i, (enq, proc) in enumerate(tasks)]
    
    # Sort tasks in reverse order based on enqueue time
    tasks.sort(reverse=True)

    result = []
    heap = []
    time = 0

    while tasks or heap:
        # Add tasks with enqueue time at or before the current time to the heap
        while tasks and tasks[-1][0] <= time:
            enq, proc, i = tasks.pop()
            heapq.heappush(heap, (proc, i))

        if heap:
            # Process the task with the smallest processing time from the heap
            proc, i = heapq.heappop(heap)
            time += proc
            result.append(i)
        elif tasks:
            # If the heap is empty but there are still tasks, set the time to the next enqueue time
            time = tasks[-1][0]

    return result


Dry Run:

Enumerate tasks with their original indices:
css
Copy code
tasks = [(1, 2, 0), (2, 4, 1), (3, 2, 2), (4, 1, 3)]
Sort tasks in reverse order based on enqueue time:
css
Copy code
tasks = [(4, 1, 3), (3, 2, 2), (2, 4, 1), (1, 2, 0)]
Initialize empty heap, result, and set time to 0.
Iteration 1:
Add tasks with enqueue time at or before the current time (0) to the heap: [ (4, 1, 3) ].
Pop the smallest processing time task from the heap: result = [3], time = 1.
Iteration 2:
Add tasks with enqueue time at or before the current time (1) to the heap: [ (2, 4, 1) ].
Pop the smallest processing time task from the heap: result = [3, 1], time = 5.
Iteration 3:
Add tasks with enqueue time at or before the current time (5) to the heap: [ (3, 2, 2) ].
Pop the smallest processing time task from the heap: result = [3, 1, 2], time = 7.
Iteration 4:
Add tasks with enqueue time at or before the current time (7) to the heap: [ (1, 2, 0) ].
Pop the smallest processing time task from the heap: result = [3, 1, 2, 0], time = 9.
All tasks are processed, and the final result is [3, 1, 2, 0].
Result:
The order in which the CPU will process the tasks is [3, 1, 2, 0]. Each element in the 
result corresponds to the index of a task in the original tasks list.


Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
