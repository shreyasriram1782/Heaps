Key Data Structures
Max Heap: Used for storing characters sorted by their frequency in descending order.
Enhanced Breakdown
Initialization:

Count the frequency of each character in the string.
Populate the max heap with these frequencies.
Processing Each Character:

Pop the top two characters from the max heap (i.e., the ones with the highest frequency).
Append these two characters to the result string.
Decrement their frequencies and re-insert them back into the max heap.
If only one character remains in the heap, make sure it doesn't exceed 
half of the string length, otherwise, return an empty string.
Wrap-up:

If there's a single remaining character with a frequency of 1, 
append it to the result.
Join all the characters to return the final reorganized string.
Example:
Given the input "aab":

Max heap after initialization: [(-2, 'a'), (-1, 'b')]
Result after first iteration: "ab"
Wrap-up: Result is "aba"

class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        freq_map = {}
        for char in s:
            freq_map[char] = freq_map.get(char, 0) + 1
            
        max_heap = [(-freq, char) for char, freq in freq_map.items()]
        heapq.heapify(max_heap)
        
        res = []
        
        while len(max_heap) >= 2:
            freq1, char1 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            freq2, char2 = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            
            res.extend([char1, char2])
            
            if freq1 + 1 < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (freq1 + 1, char1))
            if freq2 + 1 < 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (freq2 + 1, char2))
                
        if max_heap:
            freq, char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            if -freq > 1:
                return ""
            res.append(char)
            
        return "".join(res)

Time Complexity:
Priority Queue Approach: O(nlog⁡k)

O(n) for counting the frequency of each character in the string. Here, n is the length of the string.
O(klog⁡k) for building the max heap, where kkk is the number of unique characters in the string.
The heap operations (insertion and deletion) would require log⁡k\log klogk time each. 
In the worst-case scenario, you would be doing these operations nnn times (once for each character in the string).


For both approaches, you would need an additional data structure (either a max heap or an array) to store the characters and their frequencies.
In the Priority Queue Approach, the heap would contain at most kkk elements (unique characters), and the result string would contain nnn characters.
In the Array Sort Approach, the sorted array and result string would also contain nnn characters.
